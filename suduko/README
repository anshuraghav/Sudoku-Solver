               ------------------------------------------------------Description-------------------------------------------------------
This project is a Sudoku solver application that utilizes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts to solve Sudoku puzzles.
The solver is based on backtracking and recursion techniques, allowing it to efficiently find solutions for Sudoku grids of varying difficulty levels.

                ------------------------------------------------------Features----------------------------------------------------------
1.Sudoku puzzle solving using backtracking and recursion.
2.Functions to validate the correctness of the puzzle and the validity of number placements at specific positions.
3.Utilization of an efficient 2D array or matrix data structure to represent the Sudoku grid.

           ------------------------------------------------------------How it works----------------------------------------------------
The Sudoku solver works by employing a recursive backtracking algorithm. It starts by finding an empty cell in the Sudoku grid and then attempts to place a valid number (from 1 to 9) in that cell.
If the placement is valid, the solver moves on to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If it reaches a point where no valid number can be placed in a cell,
it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number.This process continues until the solver successfully fills all empty cells and finds a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.

           -------------------------------------------------------------Testing---------------------------------------------------------
The Sudoku solver has been thoroughly tested with a variety of Sudoku puzzles, including easy, medium, hard, and expert-level puzzles.
Extensive testing ensures that the solver accurately solves puzzles of different complexities and avoids common pitfalls like infinite loops or incorrect solutions.

           --------------------------------------------------------------Usage--------------------------------------------------------------
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Compile and build the Sudoku solver application.
3.Use the solver functions to solve Sudoku puzzles programmatically or load puzzles from external files.
